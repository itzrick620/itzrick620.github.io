        <h1>Lacrosse</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Lacrosse, with its origins deeply rooted in Native American history, holds a rich and storied past. It is the oldest team sport in North America, with the first games being quoted to have been played around 1100. The game's earliest forms were played by various Indigenous peoples across North America - namely the Iroquis, Seneca, and Mohawk tribes - and often with spiritual and ceremonial significance. The French colonists in the 17th century coined the term "lacrosse" due to the resemblance of the stick to a bishop's crozier. Over time, the sport evolved and gained popularity, with both Native Americans and settlers adapting and incorporating new rules. In the 19th century, modern lacrosse took shape as universities and schools established standardized regulations, leading to its eventual spread beyond North America, captivating enthusiasts worldwide with its blend of athleticism, strategy, and cultural heritage.</p>
        <h2>Growth into a College Sport</h2>
        <p>College lacrosse's rise to popularity has been nothing short of remarkable. Starting from its traditional roots, the sport gained traction in American colleges during the late 19th century as institutions like Johns Hopkins and Princeton established organized teams and rules. Fast-forward to today, and lacrosse has become a staple in the athletic programs of numerous prestigious universities. Schools like Duke, Syracuse, and the University of Virginia have emerged as powerhouses, consistently dominating the collegiate lacrosse scene with their skilled players, fierce rivalries, and intense matchups that draw massive crowds and nationwide attention. This surge in popularity has not only elevated college lacrosse to a prominent position in the realm of collegiate sports but has also contributed significantly to the sport's broader recognition and global appeal.</p>
