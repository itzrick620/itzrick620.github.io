                    <p>Luna is a 1-year-old german shephard / pitbull mix. She was recently transferred from another nearby shelter, since that shelter was at capacity and she was on a euthanization list. This puppy is full of energy, but also understands when it's time to relax and can do just that right by your side. She is full of so much love and attention and is willing to give it to any caring owner!</p>

Her favorite activity is to play fetch and pick up sticks off the ground. She is looking for a forever home since her most recent owners moved out of state and could not take her with them; please consider being the one to help her out.</p>
